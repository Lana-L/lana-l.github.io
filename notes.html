                    Multer is a node library to let end users upload files (eg, photos of their cat). Unfortunately, a lot of the documentation online does not match our specific tech stack, so I
                    documented how to use it for the stack we learned in the Dev Academy bootcamp.

                    Although it appears this query builder is on its way out, this is what we were taught in the Dev Academy and it's quite simple and intuitive to use. This cheat sheet documents the
                    most common functions and is easier to use than the official docs.
