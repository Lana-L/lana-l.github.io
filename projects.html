                <p>This started off as another carnival game, but became so much more. What was initially provided was a pre-styled board and an empty JS file. I've used the same logic for displaying the mole as what I learned in Tic-Tac-Toe - traverse through all the table cells and place the image in a random cell. The cell clicked event is also the same as what was used in Tic-Tac-Toe. The time
                  attack mode took a lot of learning about setInterval and setTimeout functions. Adding the time attack mode, the timer countdown, and leaderboard were stretch goals.</p>
                <p>I am particularly proud of the leaderboard and utilised some of the learning from the Javascript Cafe - using objects to store data and displaying them with innerHTML.</p>
