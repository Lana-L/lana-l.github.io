                <p>This was a fun project that taught us to use objects and dynamically populate information on the page. The stretch goals of having a restock button was particularly fun to implement. Other features include: in-session 'database' of stock and business cash, ability to respond when out of stock, and background music. </p>
                <p>I would still like to come back to this and implement further stretch goals, such as the customer having or not having enough money, customer asking for a refund, transaction history, and also some better styling.</p>

                <p>How much simpler can such a game be? Turns out not that easy when you have to code each little bit of it.</p>
                <p>Here we learned how to catch clicks, display objects with a click, play sounds, and keep score. I also spent a lot of time styling this (and then carried over the same styling to the Mole project) - using CSS Grid Areas made a lot of sense after using them here. I would like to come back to this one and add an "against the computer" mode. </p>

                <p>This is a simple 'game' where you use the keyboard arrow keys to interact with the image. A 'save this image' button is also included, but this was pre-built for us. Main learning here was how to catch keypress events.</p>

                <p>This is a simple 'game' where you click on the unicorn to inflate its balloon horn. Main learning here was how to catch onclick events (which we already learned in Tic-Tac-Toe), and to cycle through images to catch the correct clicks.</p>
                <p>A simpler solution may have been to give an ID to each individual unicorn, but I wanted to get this done without changing the HTML that was provided.</p>
                <p>Although simple to code, several hours were spent finding the right sounds on the various free sound websites.</p>

                <p>This started off as another carnival game, but became so much more. What was initially provided was a pre-styled board and an empty JS file. I've used the same logic for displaying the mole as what I learned in Tic-Tac-Toe - traverse through all the table cells and place the image in a random cell. The cell clicked event is also the same as what was used in Tic-Tac-Toe. The time
                  attack mode took a lot of learning about setInterval and setTimeout functions. Adding the time attack mode, the timer countdown, and leaderboard were stretch goals.</p>
                <p>I am particularly proud of the leaderboard and utilised some of the learning from the Javascript Cafe - using objects to store data and displaying them with innerHTML.</p>

                <p>This was a challenge from The Odin Project. Has no styling, but I felt pretty proud of implementing all the score-keeping. Should come back to it and make it prettier.</p>
