                    This started off as another carnival game, but became so much more. What was initially provided was a pre-styled board and an empty JS file. I've used the same logic for displaying
                    the mole as what I learned in Tic-Tac-Toe - traverse through all the table cells and place the image in a random cell. The cell clicked event is also the same as what was used in
                    Tic-Tac-Toe. The time attack mode took a lot of learning about setInterval and setTimeout functions. Adding the time attack mode, the timer countdown, and leaderboard were stretch
                    goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>I am particularly proud of the leaderboard and utilised some of the learning from the Javascript Cafe - using objects to store data and displaying them with innerHTML.</p>

                    Here we learned how to catch clicks, display objects with a click, play sounds, and keep score. I also spent a lot of time styling this (and then carried over the same styling to
                    the Mole project) - using CSS Grid Areas made a lot of sense after using them here.

                  the code at all, we were just prompting in the CLI and saying yes or no. The only thing I did manually is create the repo, write the original MD with instructions, and deploy to
                  github pages. It was quite frankly soul destroying and made me feel more like a designer than a programmer (eg, "no, the box now overlaps, move it a bit to the right, remove the
                  padding please, now the map is too skinny, make the cars have a blue outline").
